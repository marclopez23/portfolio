# Project process
process:
  title: "Methodology and work process"
  content: "The project began with a benchmark of technology consultancies, both regionally and internationally, with the goal of identifying visual patterns, communication styles, and value propositions that could serve as references.\nIn parallel, we conducted workshops with the Mythod team to understand their values, priorities, and the personality the brand needed to convey.\nWith this information, we defined the visual identity: logo, color palette, typography, and a graphic language that worked consistently across both offline and digital media.\nFor the digital side, we designed a basic UI kit that allowed us to maintain consistency in components and speed up website development.\nCollaboration with stakeholders was constant throughout the process, reviewing progress and ensuring that design decisions aligned with business expectations.\nFinally, I was responsible for developing the website in WordPress, where it was necessary to create custom plugins to cover specific functionalities not offered natively by the platform. This technical work, combined with visual direction, enabled the launch of a solid, flexible product that was faithful to the brand’s new identity."

  items:
    - title: "Consistency across offline, digital, and service verticals"
      layout: "image-left"
      image: "/assets/proyectos/mythod/marcas.png"
      content: "The challenge was not only aligning the identity between print and digital, but also shaping Mythod’s different service verticals (technology, consulting, talent, design, etc.). Each line needed its own visibility within the website and materials, without losing unity with the main brand.\n\nTo solve this, we designed a flexible visual system that maintained a common foundation—typography, grid, graphic style—while allowing light variations in color usage, so that each vertical stood out without fragmenting the brand."
      
    - title: "Custom web development within WordPress"
      layout: "image-right"
      image: "/assets/proyectos/mythod/web.png"
      content: "Although the website was built on WordPress, we quickly realized the platform’s native functionalities were not enough to cover all of Mythod’s needs.\n\nInstead of forcing solutions with generic templates, we chose to develop custom plugins that added the necessary logic and flexibility.\n\nThis approach allowed us to maintain a clean, scalable structure while ensuring that design and user experience remained consistent with the new brand identity."
      
    - title: "Brand strategy with a future vision"
      layout: "image-left"
      image: "/assets/proyectos/mythod/brand.png"
      content: "Beyond solving the identity and website for the present, it was important to think about how the brand could grow and adapt as Mythod expanded services or entered new sectors.\n\nDefining solid brand guidelines covering both offline and digital uses helped build a scalable foundation and prepared the company for future growth scenarios."
      
    - title: "Emerging design standards in the Saudi market and local competition"
      layout: "image-right"
      image: "/assets/proyectos/mythod/calle.png"
      content: "In Saudi Arabia, the design and digital branding sector is in full evolution, and there were no clear benchmarks among local consultancies.\n\nIt was necessary to analyze both regional competitors and major international consultancies, then translate those insights into a proposal that felt modern, professional, and competitive in the Saudi context."
