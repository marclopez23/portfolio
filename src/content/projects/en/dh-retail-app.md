# Project information
objective: "Create a white-label application that would allow small banks to have a modern app in a short time."
role: "Product Designer"
duration: "Approximately 1 year and 3 months"
team: "3 product designers + 1 design system designer"

# Project process
process:
  title: "Competitive benchmarking and user-centered design"
  content: "The project started with a research and benchmarking phase of European banking apps to understand which features were standard and which could differentiate us.\n\nFrom there, we defined a modular system that covered basic features (accounts, transfers, payments) while allowing each bank to customize the app to its needs.\n\nWe worked iteratively, with two-week sprints in which we designed, validated with stakeholders, and refined before moving to development. In parallel, we built a shared design system based on tokens and reusable components, ensuring visual consistency and accelerating implementation.\n\nWe collaborated hand in hand with the UI development team to create flexible templates and components that could be easily adapted to different clients without duplicating work. This ensured scalability and reduced technical effort in each deployment.\n\nFinally, we prepared navigable prototypes and conducted user tests, which allowed us to validate key interactions, adjust flows, and confirm that the final experience met real market expectations."

      content: "One of the main challenges was designing a competitive application that could measure up against established apps from large European banks.\n\nTo achieve this, we conducted extensive benchmarking and prioritized critical features, ensuring the solution met usability, security, and scalability standards.\n\nIt was also key to validate that the solution addressed the real needs of end users.\n\nTo that end, we carried out interviews and testing with clients, which helped us refine flows and identify improvements early on."

      image: "/assets/proyectos/dh/modern-design.png"
      content: "During research, we found that users perceived the banking sector as too formal, rigid, and distant. We decided to take a more approachable and human visual and communication tone, differentiating ourselves from direct competitors.\n\nThis translated into the use of illustrations, microcopy, and visual resources that added freshness to the experience without losing credibility or rigor.\n\nAs a result, we created an app that was more accessible and appealing to a diverse audience."
      
    - title: "Design flexibility for varied banking flows"
      layout: "image-left"
      image: "/assets/proyectos/dh/flexible-flows.png"
      content: "The greatest value of a white-label app is its ability to adapt to different banks without compromising the quality of the experience.\n\nThatâ€™s why we designed a flexible system with parameterizable components and flows that could easily adapt to different contexts.\n\nThis not only ensured visual consistency but also simplified implementation and technical integration.\n\nThe idea was that each bank could customize the application according to its specific needs, without compromising the user experience or duplicating design efforts."
