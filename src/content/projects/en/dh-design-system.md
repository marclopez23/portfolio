# Project information
objective: "Create a cross-platform design system to serve as a reference for all company teams."
role: "Design System Designer"
duration: "Approximately 6 months."
team: "1 design system designer"

# Project process
process:
  title: "Methodology and work process"
  content: "The project began with an audit of existing products to detect visual inconsistencies, duplications, and common team needs. Based on this analysis, we defined a roadmap focused on creating a robust and scalable system.\nWe worked iteratively: first, we defined the token architecture (colors, typography, spacing) as a flexible foundation that was easy to update and extend. Then we built key components in Figma, documenting them with usage guidelines and best practices.\nIn parallel, we developed the same components in code, ensuring design and development worked in sync. This allowed us to validate that tokens and components worked consistently in real environments, reducing errors and accelerating adoption."

      content: "One of the biggest challenges was creating a solid foundation of design tokens that could adapt to the company’s different products without losing consistency. Teams needed flexibility to customize elements such as colors, typography, or spacing, but at the same time it was crucial to maintain a common structure that enabled scalability.\n\nWe defined a clear, hierarchical architecture with reusable base tokens that could be modified depending on each product’s needs. In addition, we worked closely with development teams to ensure the code implementation reflected exactly what was designed in Figma. This structure made the system easy to maintain and prepared the team for future evolutions."

      content: "Another major challenge was aligning design and development deliverables into a shared language. In the past, each team worked with different criteria, generating inconsistencies and rework.\n\nTo solve this, we created shared libraries in Figma and synchronized them with the components developed in code. This ensured both sides worked on the same foundation, with identical components and well-documented behavior rules. This integration prevented divergences and allowed designers to deliver complete flows with the confidence they would be faithfully replicated in production."

      content: "Finally, one of the biggest challenges was securing the resources needed to dedicate full-time work to the project. At first, the design system was seen as an “extra” rather than a strategic investment.\n\nWe prepared a business case showing real inconsistencies between products, duplicated efforts, and examples of how a unified system could save time and money. We also presented a functional prototype that illustrated the impact on speed and quality. Thanks to this work, we gained leadership support and the budget to continue developing and scaling the design system."
