# Project process
process:
  title: "Methodology and work process"
  content: "Since this was a startup, we began with a benchmark of reference platforms in other markets to identify best practices and differentiate Bayn from the start.\nWe defined an MVP with the minimum necessary features to go to market: basic product management, connection between makers and retailers, and an initial purchase flow. With this MVP we were able to validate the concept quickly and start growing on a solid foundation.\nFrom there, we developed the platform iteratively.\nIn parallel, we worked on the brand identity: logo, visual identity, typography, and colors, building a clear personality for the product from launch.\nAdditionally, we created a simple UI kit with reusable components that allowed us to maintain consistency across screens and accelerate the platformâ€™s evolution."

    - title: "Managing large volumes of data"

      content: "One of the biggest challenges was designing a system capable of handling products with very different structures.\n\nWhile some items were simple and without variants (for example, a mug), others could have dozens of combinations (like a garment with different sizes, colors, and materials).\n\nThe complexity lay in how to import, organize, and display that information clearly and in a scalable way, avoiding confusion for both makers and retailers."
      
    - title: "Two user segments with different needs"
      layout: "image-right"
      image: "/assets/proyectos/bayn/dos-segmentos.png"
      content: "Bayn had to serve two very different profiles: makers and retailers.\n\nThe former needed features focused on product import, inventory management, and logistics.\n\nThe latter, on the other hand, were looking for tools to browse catalogs, place orders, and make decisions based on metrics.\n\nDesigning a platform that met both needs without one experience negatively affecting the other was one of the most significant challenges of the project."
      
    - title: "Creating a small eCommerce"
      layout: "image-left" 
      image: "/assets/proyectos/bayn/ecommerce.png"
      content: "In addition to the management layer, the platform needed to integrate its own eCommerce for retailers.\n\nThis meant designing a well-structured catalog by categories, advanced filters to find products quickly, and product sheets with all relevant information. It was also necessary to include clear performance metrics, sales, and estimated margins, so that retailers could easily evaluate the profitability of their decisions within the platform itself."
