# Project process
process:
  title: "Methodology and work process"
  content: "We began by identifying the different types of indicators the system should cover: informational (contextual feedback) and criticality indicators (severity levels in clinical information). For each, we defined its semantics, associated color palette, and usage rules in different components.\nThe work was documented within the design system to ensure consistency across teams and to facilitate implementation by development. We also conducted validation sessions with medical stakeholders, who provided their expertise and helped us adjust the design to their real needs. Finally, usability tests were carried out with users to check the comprehension of the indicators in a real environment and verify their effectiveness."

      content: "Stakeholders had been using previous systems for more than 10 or 20 years, which created a strong bias toward what they already knew.\n\nThe challenge was finding a balance between introducing a more modern system and maintaining a reasonable learning curve."
