# Project process
process:
  title: "Methodology and work process"
  content: "The project started from an existing app and some concepts previously created by another agency.\nAt the beginning, user interviews were challenging due to language barriers and the bankâ€™s reluctance to acknowledge the value of research.\nTherefore, in addition to analyzing the old app, we researched local, regional, and European competitors to identify strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for improvement.\nGradually, we introduced more structured research practices: we defined user personas and traveled to Saudi Arabia to collaborate directly with stakeholders, understand the cultural context, and enrich the design with real insights.\nWith all this information, we established the design direction and worked in two-week iterations, presenting progress at the middle and end of each sprint to both stakeholders and the development team."

      content: "Saudi financial products were very different from European ones, requiring a process of understanding and adaptation.\n\nThrough interviews and workshops with local stakeholders and experts, we aligned flows and screens with market needs."
      
    - title: "Bilingual design (RTL and LTR)"
      layout: "image-right"
      image: "/assets/proyectos/snb/img-arabe.png"
      content: "Most users used the app in Arabic, although it also had to be available in English. The challenge was to design interfaces that worked in both directions (LTR and RTL) without losing consistency or usability.\n\nTo achieve this, we developed modular components and used a plugin that connected Figma with Google Sheets: external collaborators could input Arabic text, and it was automatically updated in the designs."
      
    - title: "International coordination"

      image: "/assets/proyectos/snb/img-squads.png"
      content: "The project involved more than 30 developers distributed across several countries.\n\nTo ensure consistency, we documented each component and its behavior in detail (from form validations to screen transitions) and prepared interactive prototypes that showed not only static screens but also how the app should respond in each scenario."
