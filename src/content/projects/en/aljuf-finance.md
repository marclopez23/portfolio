# Project process
process:
  title: "Methodology and work process"
  content: "The project began with research on the local market and interviews with stakeholders to understand how financing processes for SMEs worked until then. We discovered that most of them were still manual and in-person, which slowed down procedures and increased costs.\nFrom there, we defined an MVP that moved these processes to a digital environment, reducing friction for both businesses and bank managers. We worked in short iterations: designing flows, validating with business, and adjusting before moving on to high-fidelity prototypes.\nIn parallel, we built a lightweight design system, reusing components across desktop and mobile to accelerate development and maintain visual consistency. This was key because the application needed both a mobile and desktop version without duplicating design efforts or generating extra development costs.\nDuring the process, we collaborated closely with the development team, documenting interaction patterns and delivering navigable prototypes that showed not only static screens but also behaviors and form validations."

      content: "The main challenge was transforming processes that until then were carried out in-branch into 100% digital experiences.\n\nThis required designing a clear, accessible, step-by-step onboarding capable of minimizing calls to the call center and reducing the need for human assistance."
      
    - title: "Creating a desktop version with minimal development impact"
      layout: "image-right"
      image: "/assets/proyectos/aljuf/desktop.png" 
      content: "The priority was to launch the mobile version, but a desktop version was also needed.\n\nTo avoid duplicating work, we reused the same components designed for mobile and adapted them to the desktop environment, optimizing space usage and applying patterns specific to each device."
      
    - title: "The auto lease flow and its configurations"
      layout: "image-left"
      image: "/assets/proyectos/aljuf/configurador.png"
      content: "One of the most complex processes was the car leasing application, as users could choose from over 25 cars with different configurations.\n\nWe designed a flexible flow that allowed users to compare models, add or remove vehicles from the cart, and simulate financing conditions in real time. All of this needed to be delivered in a clear, fast, and error-free experience."
